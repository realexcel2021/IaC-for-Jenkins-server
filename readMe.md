Welcome to our Terraform project! Our goal is to provision three servers on AWS and install Docker on two of them, while installing Jenkins on the third server. This project is designed to simulate one Jenkins master and two slaves, allowing for efficient and streamlined management of your devops pipeline. With Terraform, we can easily automate the process of creating and configuring these servers, saving you time and effort in the long run. Let's get started!

initialize the ropository with
teraform init

next, with your aws credentials provisioned,
run 
terraform apply
